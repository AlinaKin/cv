                I spent years learning Handstand Press from as many different teachers and angles as I could. This encouraged me to step away from my yoga mat and train with hand balance acrobats from all across the world. This marked a huge shift
                in my physical practice, opening me up to much wider movement vocabulary which I now integrate into my practice and teaching.
                In this workshop we will explore how to harness the strength, flexibility and control required for handstand press using a range of different compression, flexibility and alignment drills taken from my experience in yoga, circus and
                calisthenics.

                One of the main questions I get asked about my own practice and teaching is where I get the creative inspiration from for my sequences and transitions from? I often hear students and teachers say that they find it difficult to be
                creative and feel stuck in their teaching and practice.
                In this Workshop I aim to explore how anyone can be creative by sharing tools and techniques I have learnt and developed from my background in yoga, theatre performance and directing and teaching and lecturing in schools, colleges
                and
                Universities.

                Backbends are the natural counterpose to everyday life, the majority of us spend so much time sitting that to suddenly go into a position where you’re being asked to open up can create a sense of fear and vulnerability. In this
                Workshop
                we will focus on how to open up and prepare the body safely for backbends starting with the breath and the mind body connection and how this impacts both on our life and practice. We will then go on to explore some fun
                transitions,drills
                and techniques designed to create a state of play and add a sense of lightness and freedom in your practice

          Each month chooses a different focus e.g. shoulder stability, thoracic spine mobility, hamstring flexibility.
          Throughout the month this is broken down into warm-ups, progressions and transitions designed to help you understand
          your body and develop strength whilst increasing your range of motion.

        <h3> Creative Vinyasa </h3>
        Inspired by vinyasa yoga and dance this class links breath to movement helping you to find your flow state and switch off from the chaos and stresses of modern day life. Each class will explore a signature motif e.g. waves, circles,
        spirals
        exploring how it can be used to explore the transitions in and out of poses and discover a sense of fun, fluidity and freedom in your practice.</h4>

        <h3> Flexibility Flow </h3>
        Inspired by vinyasa yoga, thai massage and dance the class will start with self-massage and myofascial release techniques before gently flowing into a vinyasa sequence designed to gradually open up the area of the body we are working
        on.
        The class will then blend into longer static holds and self assists to support you to go deeper into each pose, finding your physical edge in a safe and supported way.

              <span>I have had the pleasure of being taught by Becky for sometime and i feel truly blessed. She has an unconditional acceptance of all those who attend her classes; beginners through to experts. Becky is highly gifted in her
                craft and remains humble to her purpose. She guides her pupils with gentle passion and warmth. It is an absolute delight to attend the classes she teaches - I find the hour goes by in a flash. I can’t imagine I’ll ever find another
                practitioner
                with the same high skill set and personal attributes that make Becky exceptional in her approach. Becky is a truly unique and shining light <br>

                flexible through practicing with her virtually. What i liked most is her ability to guide her students towards the practice of yoga. The practice is accessible for every level because she will offer modifications for those who are
                not able to
                perform in those advance poses yet.
